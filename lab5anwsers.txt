For a.c


första lfdx instruktion klar på klockcykel 49 på rad 13

The last lfdx (floating point load instruction) is instruction nr 707, and there are 7 instructions per iteration, finshed on cycle nr 341

There are about 3 clock cycles per iteration 

For b.c:

first lfdx is on row 17, cycle 51

there are 7 instructions per iteration

the last is instruction 704, and cycle 653, total about 6 cycles per iteration

for intopt:

fdiv (floating division) is stalling a lot, example instruction 200

rename registers allows the processor to temporarily store instructions and operations while they are being procsessed. It essentially allows for executing instructions
in a different order from the original program order. 

Speculative execution is when the processor executes some instructions before knowing if it will actually need to or not, for example when branching the processor can guess 
which branch will be jumped to and start executing instructions for that branch before it is sure that we will need those computations. This uses rename registers in order
to save the values of our computations and can then use the values in those registers if it turns out they are needed. 

for Speculative execution is is necessary to use rename registers while non-Speculative execution does not need but can still use rename registers.
